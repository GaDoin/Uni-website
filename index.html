        <h1>Academic Degrees We Offer</h1>
        <p>Here in the University of Vertical Radiance Technology, we offer students to choose bachelors degreee,
            masters
            degree and doctorate degree.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Bachelors Degree</h3>
                <p>A bachelor's degree or baccalaureate is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and
                    universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to six years. The two most common
                    bachelor's degrees in UVRT are the Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Engineering. In some
                    institutions and
                    educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate
                    educations after a first degree has been completed, although more commonly the successful completion
                    of a bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for further courses such as a master's or a doctorate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Masters Degree</h3>
                <p>A master's degree is an academic degree awarded by UVRT upon completion of a
                    course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area
                    of professional practice. A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's
                    level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied,
                    master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical
                    and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application;
                    and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Doctorate Degree</h3>
                <p>A doctorate or doctor's degree or doctoral degree is an academic degree awarded by UVRT,
                    derived from the ancient formalism licentia docendi. In most countries, a research degree qualifies
                    the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field or work in a specific profession.
                    There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy, awarded in many
                    different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines.</p>

                    <p> Hi, I am Justine! I studied Computer Science at the University of Vertical Radiance Technology,
                        and today I am
                        going to be sharing a few of my favourite memories from my time at university. My most wonderful
                        memory was when I first time going to the 'Sport festival' in second year after final exams were
                        over. It rained the entire time, but it was so fun. My final memory: I
                        undertook a placement year as part of my degree, which gave me the chance to
                        live in Sydney. This meant I was working as an intern in my third year. As well as gaining
                        insight into the working world, I managed to scout out some great foodie spots too. Overall, it
                        had been a great
                        experience, well worth it and extremely recommended.</p>

                    <p> Hi, I'm Dominic, and these are some of my favourite memories from my time at UVRT. Firstly, I
                        miss sitting around in coffee shops - sometimes alone, sometimes with friends. When alone, it
                        would be my chance to either sit and ‘organise my life’, or just watch people, cyclists,
                        tourists walk along the cobbled streets of Sydney Opera House from the foggy coffee shop
                        windows. With
                        friends, the coffee shop sometimes took a different form, it might have been a quick cuppa to
                        debrief the antics of the night before, or a group study session. And my last memory is even
                        when it
                        comes to something as gruelling as exams, sitting them at home is nothing like being at uni,
                        where you and your friends are studying, taking coffee breaks, worrying together and finishing
                        exams together. Damn, I miss those times.
                    </p>
