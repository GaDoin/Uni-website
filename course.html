        <h1>Our Facilities</h1>
        <p>We have the best facilities throughout all universities in Australia that will motivate your
            studies at UVRT.</p>

        <div class="row">

                <img src="images/library.png">
                <h3>World Class Library</h3>
                <p>Access to a well-stocked library makes it a lot easier to complete your assignments and get some
                    quiet study done between classes. Some institutions also house faculty-specific libraries (such as
                    for business or law) or subject-specific libraries (such as for cinema studies). Most facilities
                    also stock plenty of fiction, magazines and even DVDs, and most allow personal internet use. Staff
                    are on hand to answer any questions or help you locate resources and run regular sessions to assist
                    students to develop information research skills. These generally occur at the beginning of each
                    semester.</p>

                <h3>Largest Play Ground</h3>
                <p>University of Vertical Radiance Technology's basketball arena is the biggest by a landslide, coming
                    in first place with 34,847 seats.
                    The huge space makes more sense once you know that the Orange football and lacrosse teams also play
                    there — and the capacity is increased to 49,356 for those games. UVRT’s fans have a new reason to
                    get excited about the massive arena that originally opened in 1978 — renovations coming in the next
                    few years include a new roof, scoreboard and air conditioning.</p>

                <h3>Tasty and Healthy Food</h3>
                <p>To ensure quality and hygiene of the food, a Canteen Committee looks after
                    the menu selection and quality of service.
                    Fast food, lunch, snack bars, baked goods, tea and coffee can be found at our campus.

                    Cafeteria provides fresh meals prepared according to hygienic rules. It is a place where students
                    enjoy their favorite meals and have social interaction and they discuss academic and social issues
                    with fellow students. A committee is deputed to check and examine quantity, quality and rates of the
                    food at the university. It also monitors the hygenic conditions of the cafeteria.</p>
